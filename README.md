# The PropStop Advanced Statistical Analysis Model (Alpha 1.0)

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a sophisticated statistical model designed to predict outcomes based on a wide range of variables. Initially focused on [specific domain - e.g., sports analytics], the model aims to incorporate historical data, matchup specifics, and situational factors to enhance its predictive accuracy.

## Future Goals

1. **Extend Model to Include All Relevant Statistics:** Expand the model's capacity to incorporate a comprehensive range of statistical data deemed crucial for accurate predictions.

2. **Incorporate Historical Data:** Utilize data from previous years to understand trends and patterns that might influence future outcomes.

3. **Matchup Analysis:** Integrate matchup-specific data to assess how different opponents or conditions might affect the results.

4. **Consideration of Situational Factors:** Include variables such as rest days, home/away status, and other relevant situational factors to refine the modelâ€™s predictions.

5. **Experiment with Window Sizes:** Test various window sizes in data analysis to determine the optimal timeframe for data consideration.

6. **Utilize Standard Deviations:** Explore the use of standard deviations, rather than solely relying on mean values, to better understand data variability and distribution.

7. **Test Different Window Sizes:** Experiment with multiple window sizes to ascertain the most effective range for data analysis.

8. **Develop a Generalized Model:** Aim to create a model that can be adapted for various domains or fields, enhancing its utility and applicability.

9. **Continuous Improvement and Testing:** Regularly update and test the model to ensure its accuracy and relevance in changing scenarios.
