PropStop Model Alpha 1.0: Advanced Statistical Analysis Model
Introduction
This project involves the development of a sophisticated statistical model designed to predict outcomes based on a wide range of variables. Initially focused on [specific domain - e.g., sports analytics], the model aims to incorporate historical data, matchup specifics, and situational factors to enhance its predictive accuracy.

Future Goals
Extend Model to Include All Relevant Statistics: Expand the model's capacity to incorporate a comprehensive range of statistical data deemed crucial for accurate predictions.

Incorporate Historical Data: Utilize data from previous years to understand trends and patterns that might influence future outcomes.

Matchup Analysis: Integrate matchup-specific data to assess how different opponents or conditions might affect the results.

Consideration of Situational Factors: Include variables such as rest days, home/away status, and other relevant situational factors to refine the modelâ€™s predictions.

Experiment with Window Sizes: Test various window sizes in data analysis to determine the optimal timeframe for data consideration.

Utilize Standard Deviations: Explore the use of standard deviations, rather than solely relying on mean values, to better understand data variability and distribution.

Test Different Window Sizes: Experiment with multiple window sizes to ascertain the most effective range for data analysis.

Develop a Generalized Model: Aim to create a model that can be adapted for various domains or fields, enhancing its utility and applicability.

Continuous Improvement and Testing: Regularly update and test the model to ensure its accuracy and relevance in changing scenarios.
